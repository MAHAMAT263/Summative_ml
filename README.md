Linear Regression
This repository features code for building linear regression models through various methods, including NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and gradient descent. The primary objective is to forecast sales based on TV marketing expenditures.

Dataset
The dataset for this task is contained in a CSV file named tvmarketing.csv, which includes two columns: TV, representing TV marketing expenses, and Sales, reflecting the corresponding sales figures.
